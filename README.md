# Receipt App Prototype

A prototype for an app that lets users scan digital receipts using QR codes. The backend is made with Python and Django. The frontend is made with Dart and Flutter.

Shop owners and admins can add items and their information. When a purchase is made a receipt is generated and users can scan it using a QR code. After scanning it the receipt is added to their history, where they can see information (date, price, item, etc) about each purchase.

Made in September 2019.
